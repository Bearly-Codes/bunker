An Amateur's Take on an Idle Game


Currently has about 5 minutes of gameplay, max, but it's an extremely easy to expand base, adding new objectives, resources, bulidings, tech, or tabs in the central container is quite literally just adding a variable to an array.

The end goal is to have multiple tabs that unlock (or disappear when past their usefulness) worth of content, unique objectives, and a full story expressed through the console that ties in with the objectives the player is pursuing. Anyone who's found any issues or would like to help out is more than welcome to email me at bogann@purdue.edu. Even if I can't make good use of your help nobody's stopping you from forking the repo and making the game your own!
